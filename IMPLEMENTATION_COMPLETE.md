## 📈 **TRACKING WORKFLOW**

### **Enhanced Detection Process**
```
📊 Traditional Detection (URLs, profiles, GraphQL)
     ↓
📝 Post-Based Analysis (creation/joining keywords)
     ↓
🧠 Activity Pattern Analysis (hashtags, mentions)
     ↓
🔄 Result Merging & Deduplication
     ↓
📊 Confidence Scoring & Validation
     ↓
🔔 Comprehensive Change Notifications
```

### **Real-Time Monitoring**
- ✅ **15-minute intervals** (configurable)
- ✅ **Multiple detection methods** per cycle
- ✅ **Confidence-based filtering** (threshold configurable)
- ✅ **Detailed change reports** with method attribution

---

## 🔧 **CONFIGURATION OPTIONS**

### **Detection Parameters**
```python
# Post analysis window
hours_lookback = 24  # Analyze last 24 hours of tweets

# Confidence thresholds
creation_confidence_min = 0.7  # Minimum for creation alerts
joining_confidence_min = 0.6   # Minimum for joining alerts

# Activity thresholds
activity_patterns = {
    'high_engagement': 3,      # Replies per hour threshold
    'community_mentions': 2,   # Community account mentions
    'hashtag_usage': 5,        # Community hashtags per day
}
```

### **Scanning Modes**
```python
# Deep scan (recommended for initial setup)
deep_scan = True  # All methods + extended analysis

# Quick scan (for frequent monitoring)
deep_scan = False  # Traditional + fast post analysis
```
